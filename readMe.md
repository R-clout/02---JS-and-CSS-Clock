# Clock CSS + Js javaScript

## Overview

This is a analog clock created using Javascript. All we had to do was request the current time, derived our seconds, minutes and hour from the date function and added it on the clock. calculating the degrees at which each hand of the clock moved.


i noticed a glitch in the app where theres a twitching when the second hits the transform-origin.

I was hoping i could get some help with that.
